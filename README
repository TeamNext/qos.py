QoS - Quality of Service

WHY
=====

1. frontend rate limit, prevent resource being exhausted
2. traffic shaping, cut the spikes
3. backend rate limit, do not put too much pressure on the upstream (such as 3rd party api)
4. resource utilization, when not busy, allocate as many as we can
5. fair scheduling, one user should not block other users from basic service
6. business priority, high priority business can be handled first


FUTURE
========
1. access logging
2. performance logging
3. control panel to adjust priority
4. dashboard to see healthiness
5. performance stats based scheduling
6. access control
